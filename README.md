# CS-375: Computer Graphics
Projects and Assignments for CS-375: Computer Graphics, under the instruction of Dave Shriner.

This repository contains my projects and assignments for Sonoma State's CS-375 class for Computer Graphics. We are working in WebGL to create everything in this class with the hope that we are able to grasp the basics of graphics as a whole.

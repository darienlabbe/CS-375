# Week Two Update
Having completed week two of the final project, I have an update on what I have completed thus far:

So far, I have completed the modeling of the room and have begun research on how to implement this conjunction of models into a three.js space. I have two main approaches in my head and I am not sure which option is more viable. I will either attempt to import each model as is using the current model data, or join all of the models together into one large model with varyious textures mapped to different parts of this grandiose model. I still don't know much about how three.js imports models so I will have to keep learning and potentially learn through my own trial and error. So my goal for week three is to have a working three.js implementation of my model.

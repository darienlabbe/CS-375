# Final Project for CS 375

For my final project I had to give it a lot of thought. I had a lot of ideas running through my head, most of them a bit too ambitious for the remaining few weeks of instruction left, and some perhaps not quite ambitious enough. I have had a lot of previous experience with blender, the open source 3D modeling application, so I knew that I wanted to meld three.js with blender in some sort of way. I also knew that I wanted to create something with at least some sort of user interaction. So I decided that I wanted to create a 3d scene to walk around and look at from all angles.

### My Project Details
The major things that I want to accomplish with this project: 
1. I want to create the 3d scene as a model in blender
2. I want to import this model, along with the textures/model materials into three.js
3. I want some sort of user interactivity, whether that is point and click or 3D movement within the scene I don't mind either

Some things that I would like to add if everything goes well:
1. I would like my scene to resemble reality, I would like to add in some sort of lighting to give the scene some sort of feel
2. I would love to add this scene to my portfolio website, allowing for anyone to interact with my project in real time.

### Timeline
My hopeful timeline for this project is as follows:
+ Week 1: Create the canvas view and create the scene in blender
+ Week 2: Finish the scene with lighting (as reference) and materials/textures and import the scene into three.js and ensure that it is visible
+ Week 3: Improve the shading/lighting and catch up with anything that I may have fallen behind on. 
+ Week 4: Develop some sort of movement and potentially add the scene to my website for presentation.

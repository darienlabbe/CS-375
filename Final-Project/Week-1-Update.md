# Week One Update

Having completed week one of the final project, I have an update on what I have completed thus far:

So far, I have modeled out a room that still needs to be filled with more models to complete the space but, in general the main space has been created and completed for the most part. Having completed this, I now am looking to complete the model in its entirety and upload a number of renders of the space as intended. Then I want to import the space as a single model with many different textures and colors into three.js. This will hinge on me doing further research into how to accomplish this.

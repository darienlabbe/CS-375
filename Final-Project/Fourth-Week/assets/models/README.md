# Model Folder Info

In order to upload the very large model files (over a gigabyte in data), I needed to compress them using 7zip into separate volumes. Here there should be 26 volumes that, when you right click the first volume and go to 7zip and then select "Extract to models/", then a folder will be created called models which will contain another folder also named models which contains the four necessary models. In order to prevent having any issues with file fetching, ensure that the models folder that is inside the created unzipped folder is placed in the assets folder for the project.

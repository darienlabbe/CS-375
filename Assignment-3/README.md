# Assignment 3

This assignment is mainly focused on Modeling, Animation, and Depth Buffering in JavaScript in order to better understand graphics in WebGL. This assignment required creating a Cube.html file, a main.js file, and a Cube.js object file. The goal was to build upon the basics that we learned in Assignment 2 and to continue into much more complex ideas. Mainly setting up position, indices, and color matrices, using helper files to create more complex attributes and uniforms, and using a continuously updating motion variable that allows for animation of the model.

Note to Professor: I was not aware that we should be committing as we go for this project and so I did indeed do one large commit after having finished the assignment. In the future I will follow a more step by step commit, perhaps after every major milestone I will make a new updated commit in order to demonstrate my progress.

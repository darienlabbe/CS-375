# Solar System Project 
Here I will be adding my code for the solar system project. The goal is to use the matrix stack to streamline the creation of a sun object, earth object, and moon object. The sun rotates on its own z-axis while the earth roates around it, to represent years, and rotates around itself to represent days. The moon rotates around the earth while the earth rotates around the sun.
